Welcome to my Card Game of War program written in C++

For those that download the file please note that the .vs folder is mising as it cannot be copied to git, this should not be an issue.

Upon iniitally opening the project all .cpp files except for main.cpp should be excluded from the primary build (in Visual Studio). If the files are not this can be fixed by right clicking each file -> Properties -> Excluded From Build and setting this to "Yes", from here rebuild the solution.
